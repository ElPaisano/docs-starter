# IPFS Docs v2.0

This repository contains example layouts for the proposed v2.0 of the [ipfs-docs](https://github.com/protocol/docs-starter). Unlike the current ipfs-docs site, this site is built on @johhnymatthew's WIP [docs-starter](https://github.com/protocol/docs-starter), a handy Hugo-based platform to quicky create technical documentation.

## Overview

This repo currently contains the following branches:

- _proposal-1_: this is the branch containing the layout for proposal 1.
- _proposal-3_: this is the branch containing the layout for proposal 3.
- _test_: this is the branch that is used for testsing purposes, and is liable to change at any time
- _main_: this branch matches the main branch of [docs-starter](https://github.com/protocol/docs-starter)
